- ðŸ¤™ Hey, I'm @taylorrob458!

- ðŸ¥€ I love *reading*, *rock climbing*, *skateboarding*, and *hiking*,<br>
but perhaps most of all I love *music*. Iâ€™m a musician myself and<br>
have released several albums online, two of which on Spotify and<br>
Apple Music under the name ***Dingo Paisley***.

- ðŸš€ I've travelled across globe and a few years ago I moved to<br>
*St. Petersburg*, *Russia* where I've been learning the language,<br>
performing music, and teaching English. I intend to move again in the<br>
next year or so, perhaps back to the *US*.

- ðŸŒµ I know many programming languages, but some of the ones I'm most<br>
familiar with are *Java*, *Python*, *HTML*, *CSS*, and *JavaScript*. Right<br>
now I'm working on improving my *Python* and I'm trying to learn *PHP*. 
Aside from that I'm starting to work with *API*s and beginning to take<br>
courses on *game design*, which is where I ultimately want to go in my<br>
tech career!

- ðŸ¦‹ I'm always looking to expand my skills, especially in *game design*,<br>
*music* (I generally use *Logic Pro X*, so if you wanna collab musically,<br>
maybe we can set up a repository and do some cool stuff!), or related<br>
spheres. So if you'd like to collaberate hit me up!
